Make sure, to run this command to copy the .env file
"copy .env.example to .env" and after that run this one too "php artisan:key generate"

Those command was supposed to set an .env for server settings.

After that, please run either "composer install" or "composer update", to install the library that wasn't included in repository.

If you want check the database, i'll already provide it in the dump sql server if you want to use export feautre.
But, if you want to run the migration it's also fine, since i already provide for the faker on the categories table.

I use, API_KEY for the authorization and put it in the .env file, make sure to add 'x-api-key' in the headers if you use postman for testing. I also provide the collection json if you want, so you can just import it. It's in dump file also
